## My process

I made the whole website for desktop screen with HTML and CSS. I have used Flexbox as well. Then in order to make it responsive I have used Bootstrap navbar, 12 column grid system and media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap grid
- media query
- fontawesome icons

### What I learned

This project has been a challenge. I have learned a lot of things. Like -

- Positioning property,

- SVG fill property in order to change its colour,

- Making reusable css class like making a blue or orange button and apply that class to the required areas,

- Filter property of image in order to change its colour,

- Applying Bootstrap javascript "data-bs-ride" to my custom buttons as I have used in the testimonial section,

- Making google map responsive to the screen size etc.

### Continued development

I am still curious how I can position correctly the Get in Touch section horizontal line which gets transformed into a vertical line in small screens. In the Follow Us section its the same thing - for small screens, the position is not yet correct. I would appreciate any helpful tips.
